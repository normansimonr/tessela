Daniel (Old Greek),4,17,True,"The matter is by the decree of the watcher, and the demand is a word of the holy ones; that the living may know that the Lord is most high over the kingdom of men, and he will give it to whomsoever he shall please, and will set up over it that which is set at nought of men.",,,
Daniel (Old Greek),4,18,True,"This is the vision which I king Nabuchodonosor saw: and do thou, Baltasar, declare the interpretation, for none of the wise men of my kingdom are able to shew me the interpretation of it: but thou, Daniel, art able; for the Holy Spirit of God is in thee.",,,
Daniel (Old Greek),4,19,True,"Then Daniel, whose name is Baltasar, was amazed about one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. And Baltasar answered and said, My lord, let the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation of it to thine enemies.",,,

Daniel (Old Greek),5,7,True,"And the king cried aloud to bring in the magicians, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; and he said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and make known to me the interpretation, shall be clothed with scarlet, and there shall be a golden chain upon his neck, and he shall be the third ruler in my kingdom.",,,
Daniel (Old Greek),5,8,True,"Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known the interpretation to the king.",,,
Daniel (Old Greek),5,9,True,"And king Baltasar was troubled, and his countenance changed upon him, and his nobles were troubled with him.",,,

Daniel (Old Greek),6,8,True,"All who preside over thy kingdom, captains and satraps, chiefs and local governors, have taken counsel together, to establish by a royal statute and to confirm a decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions.",,,

Daniel (Old Greek),6,21,True,"And when he drew near to the den, he cried with a loud voice, Daniel, servant of the living God, has thy God, whom thou servest continually, been able to deliver thee from the lion's mouth?",,,
Daniel (Old Greek),6,22,True,"And Daniel said to the king, O king, live for ever.",,,
Daniel (Old Greek),6,23,True,"My God has sent his angel, and stopped the lions' mouths, and they have not hurt me: for uprightness was found in me before him; and moreover before thee, O king, I have committed no trespass.",,,

Daniel (Old Greek),6,25,True,"And the king commanded, and they brought the men that had accused Daniel, and they were cast into the den of lions, they, and their children, and their wives: and they reached not the bottom of the den before the lions had the mastery of them, and utterly broke to pieces all their bones.",,,

Daniel (Old Greek),9,11,True,"Moreover all Israel have transgressed thy law, and have refused to hearken to thy voice; so the curse has come upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.",,,
Daniel (Old Greek),9,12,True,"And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us great evils, such as have not happened under the whole heaven, according to what has happened in Jerusalem.",,,
Daniel (Old Greek),9,13,True,"As it is written in the law of Moses, all these evils have come upon us: yet we have not besought the Lord our God, that we might turn away from our iniquities, and have understanding in all thy truth.",,,

Daniel (Old Greek),9,17,True,"And now, O Lord our God, hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine on thy desolate sanctuary, for thine own sake, O Lord.",,,
Daniel (Old Greek),9,18,True,"Incline thine ear, O my God, and hear; open thine eyes and behold our desolation, and that of thy city on which thy name is called: for we do not bring our pitiful case before thee on the ground of our righteousness, but on the ground of thy manifold compassions, O Lord.",,,

Daniel (Old Greek),9,26,True,"And after the sixty-two weeks, the anointed one shall be destroyed, and there is no judgment in him: and he shall destroy the city and the sanctuary with the prince that is coming: they shall be cut off with a flood, and to the end of the war which is rapidly completed he shall appoint the city to desolations.",,,
Daniel (Old Greek),9,27,True,And one week shall establish the covenant with many: and in the midst of the week my sacrifice and drink-offering shall be taken away: and on the temple shall be the abomination of desolations, and at the end of the time an end shall be put to the desolation.,,

Esther,2,12,True,"Now this was the time for a virgin to go in to the king, when she should have fulfilled twelve months; for so are the days of purification fulfilled, six months while they are anointing themselves with oil of myrrh, and six months with spices and women's purifications.",,,
Esther,2,13,True,"And then the damsel goes in to the king; and the officer to whomsoever he shall give the command, will bring her to come in with him from the women's apartment to the king's chamber.",,,

Esther,3,3,True,"And they in the king's palace said to Mardochæus, Mardochæus, why dost thou transgress the commands of the king?",,,
Esther,3,4,True,"Thus they spoke daily to him, but he hearkened not unto them; so they represented to Aman that Mardochæus resisted the commands of the king: and Mardochæus had shewn to them that he was a Jew.",,,
Esther,3,5,True,"And when Aman understood that Mardochæus did not obeisance to him, he was greatly enraged,",,,
Esther,3,6,True,and took counsel to destroy utterly all the Jews who were under the rule of Artaxerxes.,,,
Esther,3,7,True,"And he made a decree in the twelfth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, and cast lots daily and monthly, to slay in one day the race of Mardochæus: and the lot fell on the fourteenth day of the month which is Adar.",,,
Esther,3,8,True,"And he spoke to king Artaxerxes, saying, There is a nation scattered among the nations in all thy kingdom, and their laws differ from those of all the other nations; and they disobey the laws of the king; and it is not expedient for the king to let them alone.",,,
Esther,3,9,True,"If it seem good to the king, let him make a decree to destroy them: and I will remit into the king's treasury ten thousand talents of silver.",,,
Esther,3,10,True,"And the king took off his ring, and gave it into the hands of Aman, to seal the decrees against the Jews.",,,
Esther,3,11,True,"And the king said to Aman, Keep the silver, and treat the nation as thou wilt.",,,
Esther,3,12,True,"So the king's recorders were called in the first month, on the thirteenth day , and they wrote as Aman commanded to the captains and governors in every province, from India even to Ethiopia, to a hundred and twenty-seven provinces; and to the rulers of the nations according to their several languages, in the name of king Artaxerxes.",,,
Esther,3,13,True,"And the message was sent by posts throughout the kingdom of Artaxerxes, to destroy utterly the race of the Jews on the first day of the twelfth month, which is Adar, and to plunder their goods.",,,
Esther,3,14,True,"[And the following is the copy of the letter; The great king Artaxerxes writes thus to the rulers and inferior governors of a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia, who hold authority under him .",,,
Esther,3,14,True,And the copies of the letters were published in every province, and an order was given to all the nations to be ready against that day.,,
Esther,3,15,True,"Ruling over many nations, and having obtained dominion over the whole world, I was minded, (not elated by the confidence of power, but ever conducting myself with great moderation and with gentleness,) to make the lives of my subjects continually tranquil, desiring both to maintain the kingdom quiet and orderly to its utmost limits, and to restore the peace desired by all men.",,,
Esther,3,15,True,"And the business was hastened, and that at Susa: and the king and Aman began to drink; but the city was troubled.",,,
Esther,4,1,True,"But Mardochæus having perceived what was done, rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, and sprinkled dust upon himself; and having rushed forth through the open street of the city, he cried with a loud voice, A nation that has done no wrong is going to be destroyed.",,,
Esther,4,2,True,"And he came to the king's gate, and stood; for it was not lawful for him to enter into the palace, wearing sackcloth and ashes.",,,
Esther,4,3,True,"And in every province where the letters were published, there was crying and lamentation and great mourning on the part of the Jews: they spread for themselves sackcloth and ashes.",,,
Esther,4,4,True,"And the queen's maids and chamberlains went in and told her: and when she had heard what was done, she was disturbed; and she sent to clothe Mardochæus, and take away his sackcloth; but he consented not.",,,
Esther,4,5,True,"So Esther called for her chamberlain Achrathæus, who waited upon her; and she sent to learn the truth from Mardochæus.",,,
Esther,4,6,True,,,,
Esther,4,7,True,"And Mardochæus shewed him what was done, and the promise which Aman had made the king of ten thousand talents to be paid into the treasury, that he might destroy the Jews.",,,
Esther,4,8,True,"And he gave him the copy of the writing that was published in Susa concerning their destruction, to shew to Esther; and told him to charge her to go in and intreat the king, and to beg him for the people, remembering, said he , the days of thy low estate, how thou wert nursed by my hand: because Aman who holds the next place to the king has spoken against us for death. Do thou call upon the Lord, and speak to the king concerning us, to deliver us from death.",,,
Esther,4,9,True,So Achrathæus went in and told her all these words.,,,
Esther,4,10,True,"And Esther said to Achrathæus, Go to Mardochæus, and say,",,,
Esther,4,11,True,"All the nations of the empire know, that whoever, man or woman, shall go in to the king into the inner court uncalled, that person cannot live: only to whomsoever the king shall stretch out his golden sceptre, he shall live: and I have not been called to go in to the king, for these thirty days.",,,
Esther,4,12,True,And Achrathæus reported to Mardochæus all the words of Esther.,,,
Esther,4,13,True,"Then Mardochæus said to Achrathæus, Go, and say to her, Esther, say not to thyself that thou alone wilt escape in the kingdom, more than all the other Jews.",,,
Esther,4,15,True,"And Esther sent the man that came to her to Mardochæus, saying,",,,
Esther,4,16,True,"Go and assemble the Jews that are in Susa, and fast ye for me, and eat not and drink not for three days, night and day: and I also and my maidens will fast; and then I will go in to the king contrary to the law, even if I must die.",,,
Esther,4,17,True,So Mardochæus went and did all that Esther commanded him.,,,
Esther,5,1,True,"And it came to pass on the third day, when she had ceased praying, that she put off her mean dress, and put on her glorious apparel.",,,
Esther,5,2,True,"And being splendidly arrayed, and having called upon God the Overseer and Preserver of all things, she took her two maids, and she leaned upon one, as a delicate female, and the other followed bearing her train.",,,
Esther,5,2,True,"And having raised the golden sceptre he laid it upon her neck, and embraced her, and said, Speak to me.",,,
Esther,5,3,True,"And she was blooming in the perfection of her beauty; and her face was cheerful, as it were benevolent, but her heart was straitened for fear.",,,
Esther,5,3,True,"And she said to him, I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy glory; for thou, my lord, art to be wondered at, and thy face is full of grace.",,,
Esther,5,3,True,"And the king said, What wilt thou, Esther? and what is thy request? ask even to the half of my kingdom, and it shall be thine.",,,
Esther,5,4,True,"And having passed through all the doors, she stood before the king: and he was sitting upon his royal throne, and he had put on all his glorious apparel, covered all over with gold and precious stones, and was very terrible.",,,
Esther,5,4,True,"And while she was speaking, she fainted and fell. Then the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her.]",,,
Esther,5,4,True,"And Esther said, To-day is my great day: if then it seem good to the king, let both him and Aman come to the feast which I will prepare this day.",,,
Esther,5,6,True,"But God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness, and in intense feeling he sprang from off his throne, and took her into his arms, until she recovered: and he comforted her with peaceable words, and said to her,",,,
Esther,5,6,True,"And at the banquet the king said to Esther, What is thy request , queen Esther? speak , and thou shalt have all that thou requirest.",,,
Esther,5,7,True,"What is the matter , Esther? I am thy brother; be of good cheer, thou shalt not die, for our command is openly declared to thee , Draw nigh.",,,
Esther,5,7,True,"And she said, My request and my petition are :",,,
Esther,5,8,True,"if I have found favour in the sight of the king, let the king and Aman come again to-morrow to the feast which I shall prepare for them, and to-morrow I will do the same.",,,
Esther,5,9,True,"So Aman went out from the king very glad and merry: but when Aman saw Mardochæus the Jew in the court, he was greatly enraged.",,,
Esther,5,10,True,"And having gone into his own house, he called his friends, and his wife Zosara.",,,
Esther,5,11,True,"And he shewed them his wealth, and the glory with which the king had invested him, and how he had caused him to take precedence and bear chief rule in the kingdom.",,,
Esther,5,12,True,"And Aman said, The queen has called no one to the feast with the king but me, and I am invited to-morrow.",,,
Esther,5,13,True,"But these things please me not, while I see Mardochæus the Jew in the court.",,,
Esther,5,14,True,"And Zosara his wife and his friends said to him, Let there be a gallows made for thee of fifty cubits, and in the morning do thou speak to the king, and let Mardochæus be hanged on the gallows: but do thou go in to the feast with the king, and be merry. And the saying pleased Aman, and the gallows was prepared.",,,
Esther,6,1,True,"But the Lord removed sleep from the king that night: and he told his servant to bring in the books, the registers of daily events, to read to him.",,,
Esther,6,2,True,"And he found the records written concerning Mardochæus, how he had told the king concerning the two chamberlains of the king, when they were keeping guard, and sought to lay hands on Artaxerxes.",,,
Esther,6,3,True,"And the king said, What honour or favour have we done to Mardochæus? And the king's servants said, Thou hast not done anything to him.",,,
Esther,6,4,True,"And while the king was enquiring about the kindness of Mardochæus, behold, Aman was in the court. And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Aman was come in to speak to the king, that he should hang Mardochæus on the gallows, which he had prepared.",,,
Esther,6,5,True,"And the king's servants said, Behold, Aman stands in the court. And the king said, Call him.",,,
Esther,6,6,True,"And the king said to Aman, What shall I do to the man whom I wish to honour? And Aman said within himself, Whom would the king honour but myself?",,,
Esther,6,7,True,"and he said to the king, As for the man whom the king wishes to honour,",,,
Esther,6,8,True,"let the king's servants bring the robe of fine linen which the king puts on, and the horse on which the king rides,",,,
Esther,6,9,True,"and let him give it to one of the king's noble friends, and let him array the man whom the king loves; and let him mount him on the horse, and proclaim through the street of the city, saying, Thus shall it be done to every man whom the king honours.",,,
Esther,6,10,True,"Then the king said to Aman, Thou hast well said: so do to Mardochæus the Jew, who waits in the palace, and let not a word of what thou hast spoken be neglected.",,,
Esther,6,11,True,"So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arrayed Mardochæus, and mounted him on the horse, and went through the street of the city, and proclaimed, saying, Thus shall it be to every man whom the king wishes to honour.",,,
Esther,6,12,True,"And Mardochæus returned to the palace: but Aman went home mourning, and having his head covered.",,,
Esther,6,13,True,"And Aman related the events that had befallen him to Zosara his wife, and to his friends: and his friends and his wife said to him, If Mardochæus be of the race of the Jews, and thou hast begun to be humbled before him, thou wilt assuredly fall, and thou wilt not be able to withstand him, for the living God is with him.",,,
Esther,6,14,True,"While they were yet speaking, the chamberlains arrived, to hasten Aman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.",,,
Esther,7,1,True,So the king and Aman went in to drink with the queen.,,,
Esther,7,2,True,"And the king said to Esther at the banquet on the second day, What is it, queen Esther? and what is thy request, and what is thy petition? and it shall be done for thee, to the half of my kingdom.",,,
Esther,7,3,True,"And she answered and said, If I have found favour in the sight of the king, let my life be granted to my petition, and my people to my request.",,,
Esther,7,4,True,"For both I and my people are sold for destruction, and pillage, and slavery; both we and our children for bondmen and bondwomen: and I consented not to it, for the slanderer is not worthy of the king's palace.",,,
Esther,7,5,True,"And the king said, Who is this that has dared to do this thing?",,,
Esther,7,6,True,"And Esther said, The adversary is Aman, this wicked man. Then Aman was troubled before the king and the queen.",,,
Esther,7,7,True,And the king rose up from the banquet to go into the garden: and Aman began to intreat the queen, for he saw that he was in an evil case.,,
Esther,7,8,True,"And the king returned from the garden; and Aman had fallen upon the bed, intreating the queen. And the king said, Wilt thou even force my wife in my house? And when Aman heard it, he changed countenance.",,,
Esther,7,9,True,"And Bugathan, one of the chamberlains, said to the king, Behold, Aman has also prepared a gallows for Mardochæus, who spoke concerning the king, and a gallows of fifty cubits high has been set up in the premises of Aman. And the king said, Let him be hanged thereon.",,,
Esther,7,10,True,So Aman was hanged on the gallows that had been prepared for Mardochæus: and then the king's wrath was appeased.,,,
Esther,8,1,True,And in that day king Artaxerxes gave to Esther all that belonged to Aman the slanderer: and Mardochæus was called by the king, for Esther had shewn that he was related to her.,,
Esther,8,3,True,"And she spoke yet again to the king, and fell at his feet, and besought him to do away the mischief of Aman, and all that he had done against the Jews.",,,
Esther,8,5,True,"And Esther said, If it seem good to thee, and I have found favour in thy sight , let an order be sent that the letters sent by Aman may be reversed, that were written for the destruction of the Jews, who are in thy kingdom.",,,
Esther,8,6,True,"For how shall I be able to look upon the affliction of my people, and how shall I be able to survive the destruction of my kindred?",,,

Job,31,26,True,"(do we not see the shining sun eclipsed, and the moon waning? for they have not power to continue :)",,,
Job,31,28,True,let this also then be reckoned to me as the greatest iniquity: for I should have lied against the Lord Most High.,,,
Job,31,29,True,"And if too I was glad at the fall of mine enemies, and mine heart said, Aha!",,,

Job,34,25,True,"Who discovers their works, and will bring night about upon them , and they shall be brought low.",,,
Job,34,27,True,"Because they turned aside from the law of God, and did not regard his ordinances,",,,

Esther,2,15.0,True,"And when the time was fulfilled for Esther the daughter of Aminadab the brother of Mardochæus' father to go in to the king, she neglected nothing which the chamberlain, the women's keeper, commanded; for Esther found grace in the sight of all that looked upon her."
Esther,2,16.0,True,"So Esther went in to king Artaxerxes in the twelfth month, which is Adar, in the seventh year of his reign."
Esther,2,17.0,True,"And the king loved Esther, and she found favour beyond all the other virgins: and he put on her the queen's crown."

Esther,2,19.0,True,But Mardochæus served in the palace.
Esther,2,20.0,True,"Now Esther had not discovered her kindred; for so Mardochæus commanded her, to fear God, and perform his commandments, as when she was with him: and Esther changed not her manner of life."
Esther,2,21.0,True,"And two chamberlains of the king, the chiefs of the body-guard, were grieved, because Mardochæus was promoted; and they sought to kill king Artaxerxes."
Esther,2,22.0,True,"And the matter was discovered to Mardochæus, and he made it known to Esther, and she declared to the king the matter of the conspiracy."
Esther,2,23.0,True,"And the king examined the two chamberlains, and hanged them: and the king gave orders to make a note for a memorial in the royal records of the good offices of Mardochæus, as a commendation."
Esther,3,1.0,True,"And after this king Artaxerxes highly honoured Aman son of Amadathes, the Bugæan, and exalted him, and set his seat above all his friends."
Esther,3,2.0,True,"And all in the palace did him obeisance, for so the king had given orders to do: but Mardochæus did not do him obeisance."
Esther,3,3.0,True,"And they in the king's palace said to Mardochæus, Mardochæus, why dost thou transgress the commands of the king?"
Esther,3,4.0,True,"Thus they spoke daily to him, but he hearkened not unto them; so they represented to Aman that Mardochæus resisted the commands of the king: and Mardochæus had shewn to them that he was a Jew."
Esther,3,5.0,True,"And when Aman understood that Mardochæus did not obeisance to him, he was greatly enraged,"
Esther,3,6.0,True,and took counsel to destroy utterly all the Jews who were under the rule of Artaxerxes.
Esther,3,7.0,True,"And he made a decree in the twelfth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, and cast lots daily and monthly, to slay in one day the race of Mardochæus: and the lot fell on the fourteenth day of the month which is Adar."
Esther,3,8.0,True,"And he spoke to king Artaxerxes, saying, There is a nation scattered among the nations in all thy kingdom, and their laws differ from those of all the other nations; and they disobey the laws of the king; and it is not expedient for the king to let them alone."
Esther,3,9.0,True,"If it seem good to the king, let him make a decree to destroy them: and I will remit into the king's treasury ten thousand talents of silver."
Esther,3,10.0,True,"And the king took off his ring, and gave it into the hands of Aman, to seal the decrees against the Jews."
Esther,3,11.0,True,"And the king said to Aman, Keep the silver, and treat the nation as thou wilt."
Esther,3,12.0,True,"So the king's recorders were called in the first month, on the thirteenth day , and they wrote as Aman commanded to the captains and governors in every province, from India even to Ethiopia, to a hundred and twenty-seven provinces; and to the rulers of the nations according to their several languages, in the name of king Artaxerxes."
Esther,3,13.0,True,"And the message was sent by posts throughout the kingdom of Artaxerxes, to destroy utterly the race of the Jews on the first day of the twelfth month, which is Adar, and to plunder their goods."
Esther,3,14.0,True,"[And the following is the copy of the letter; The great king Artaxerxes writes thus to the rulers and inferior governors of a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia, who hold authority under him ."
Esther,3,14.0,True,And the copies of the letters were published in every province; and an order was given to all the nations to be ready against that day.
Esther,3,15.0,True,"Ruling over many nations, and having obtained dominion over the whole world, I was minded, (not elated by the confidence of power, but ever conducting myself with great moderation and with gentleness,) to make the lives of my subjects continually tranquil, desiring both to maintain the kingdom quiet and orderly to its utmost limits, and to restore the peace desired by all men."
Esther,3,15.0,True,"And the business was hastened, and that at Susa: and the king and Aman began to drink; but the city was troubled."
Esther,4,1.0,True,"But Mardochæus having perceived what was done, rent his garments, and put on sackcloth, and sprinkled dust upon himself; and having rushed forth through the open street of the city, he cried with a loud voice, A nation that has done no wrong is going to be destroyed."
Esther,4,2.0,True,"And he came to the king's gate, and stood; for it was not lawful for him to enter into the palace, wearing sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,3.0,True,"And in every province where the letters were published, there was crying and lamentation and great mourning on the part of the Jews: they spread for themselves sackcloth and ashes."
Esther,4,4.0,True,"And the queen's maids and chamberlains went in and told her: and when she had heard what was done, she was disturbed; and she sent to clothe Mardochæus, and take away his sackcloth; but he consented not."
Esther,4,5.0,True,"So Esther called for her chamberlain Achrathæus, who waited upon her; and she sent to learn the truth from Mardochæus."
Esther,4,6.0,True,
Esther,4,7.0,True,"And Mardochæus shewed him what was done, and the promise which Aman had made the king of ten thousand talents to be paid into the treasury, that he might destroy the Jews."
Esther,4,8.0,True,"And he gave him the copy of the writing that was published in Susa concerning their destruction, to shew to Esther; and told him to charge her to go in and intreat the king, and to beg him for the people, remembering, said he , the days of thy low estate, how thou wert nursed by my hand: because Aman who holds the next place to the king has spoken against us for death. Do thou call upon the Lord, and speak to the king concerning us, to deliver us from death."
Esther,4,9.0,True,So Achrathæus went in and told her all these words.
Esther,4,10.0,True,"And Esther said to Achrathæus, Go to Mardochæus, and say,"
Esther,4,11.0,True,"All the nations of the empire know, that whoever, man or woman, shall go in to the king into the inner court uncalled, that person cannot live: only to whomsoever the king shall stretch out his golden sceptre, he shall live: and I have not been called to go in to the king, for these thirty days."
Esther,4,12.0,True,And Achrathæus reported to Mardochæus all the words of Esther.
Esther,4,13.0,True,"Then Mardochæus said to Achrathæus, Go, and say to her, Esther, say not to thyself that thou alone wilt escape in the kingdom, more than all the other Jews."
Esther,4,14.0,False,"For if thou shalt refuse to hearken on this occasion, help and protection will be to the Jews from another quarter; but thou and thy father's house will perish: and who knows, if thou hast been made queen for this very occasion?"
Esther,4,15.0,True,"And Esther sent the man that came to her to Mardochæus, saying,"
Esther,4,16.0,True,"Go and assemble the Jews that are in Susa, and fast ye for me, and eat not and drink not for three days, night and day: and I also and my maidens will fast; and then I will go in to the king contrary to the law, even if I must die."
Esther,4,17.0,True,So Mardochæus went and did all that Esther commanded him.
Esther,5,1.0,True,"And it came to pass on the third day, when she had ceased praying, that she put off her mean dress, and put on her glorious apparel."
Esther,5,2.0,True,"And being splendidly arrayed, and having called upon God the Overseer and Preserver of all things, she took her two maids, and she leaned upon one, as a delicate female, and the other followed bearing her train."
Esther,5,2.0,True,"And having raised the golden sceptre he laid it upon her neck, and embraced her, and said, Speak to me."
Esther,5,3.0,True,"And she was blooming in the perfection of her beauty; and her face was cheerful, as it were benevolent, but her heart was straitened for fear."
Esther,5,3.0,True,"And she said to him, I saw thee, my lord, as an angel of God, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy glory; for thou, my lord, art to be wondered at, and thy face is full of grace."
Esther,5,3.0,True,"And the king said, What wilt thou, Esther? and what is thy request? ask even to the half of my kingdom, and it shall be thine."
Esther,5,4.0,True,"And having passed through all the doors, she stood before the king: and he was sitting upon his royal throne, and he had put on all his glorious apparel, covered all over with gold and precious stones, and was very terrible."
Esther,5,4.0,True,"And while she was speaking, she fainted and fell. Then the king was troubled, and all his servants comforted her.]"
Esther,5,4.0,True,"And Esther said, To-day is my great day: if then it seem good to the king, let both him and Aman come to the feast which I will prepare this day."
Esther,5,5.0,False,"And having raised his face resplendent with glory, he looked with intense anger: and the queen fell, and changed her colour as she fainted; and she bowed herself upon the head of the maid that went before her ."
Esther,5,5.0,False,"And the king said, Hasten Aman hither, that we may perform the word of Esther. So they both come to the feast of which Esther had spoken."
Esther,5,6.0,True,"But God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness, and in intense feeling he sprang from off his throne, and took her into his arms, until she recovered: and he comforted her with peaceable words, and said to her,"
Esther,5,6.0,True,"And at the banquet the king said to Esther, What is thy request , queen Esther? speak , and thou shalt have all that thou requirest."
Esther,5,7.0,True,"What is the matter , Esther? I am thy brother; be of good cheer, thou shalt not die, for our command is openly declared to thee , Draw nigh."
Esther,5,7.0,True,"And she said, My request and my petition are :"
Esther,5,8.0,True,"if I have found favour in the sight of the king, let the king and Aman come again to-morrow to the feast which I shall prepare for them, and to-morrow I will do the same."
Esther,5,9.0,True,"So Aman went out from the king very glad and merry: but when Aman saw Mardochæus the Jew in the court, he was greatly enraged."
Esther,5,10.0,True,"And having gone into his own house, he called his friends, and his wife Zosara."
Esther,5,11.0,True,"And he shewed them his wealth, and the glory with which the king had invested him, and how he had caused him to take precedence and bear chief rule in the kingdom."
Esther,5,12.0,True,"And Aman said, The queen has called no one to the feast with the king but me, and I am invited to-morrow."
Esther,5,13.0,True,"But these things please me not, while I see Mardochæus the Jew in the court."
Esther,5,14.0,True,"And Zosara his wife and his friends said to him, Let there be a gallows made for thee of fifty cubits, and in the morning do thou speak to the king, and let Mardochæus be hanged on the gallows: but do thou go in to the feast with the king, and be merry. And the saying pleased Aman, and the gallows was prepared."
Esther,6,1.0,True,"But the Lord removed sleep from the king that night: and he told his servant to bring in the books, the registers of daily events, to read to him."
Esther,6,2.0,True,"And he found the records written concerning Mardochæus, how he had told the king concerning the two chamberlains of the king, when they were keeping guard, and sought to lay hands on Artaxerxes."
Esther,6,3.0,True,"And the king said, What honour or favour have we done to Mardochæus? And the king's servants said, Thou hast not done anything to him."
Esther,6,4.0,True,"And while the king was enquiring about the kindness of Mardochæus, behold, Aman was in the court. And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Aman was come in to speak to the king, that he should hang Mardochæus on the gallows, which he had prepared."
Esther,6,5.0,True,"And the king's servants said, Behold, Aman stands in the court. And the king said, Call him."
Esther,6,6.0,True,"And the king said to Aman, What shall I do to the man whom I wish to honour? And Aman said within himself, Whom would the king honour but myself?"
Esther,6,7.0,True,"and he said to the king, As for the man whom the king wishes to honour,"
Esther,6,8.0,True,"let the king's servants bring the robe of fine linen which the king puts on, and the horse on which the king rides,"
Esther,6,9.0,True,"and let him give it to one of the king's noble friends, and let him array the man whom the king loves; and let him mount him on the horse, and proclaim through the street of the city, saying, Thus shall it be done to every man whom the king honours."
Esther,6,10.0,True,"Then the king said to Aman, Thou hast well said: so do to Mardochæus the Jew, who waits in the palace, and let not a word of what thou hast spoken be neglected."
Esther,6,11.0,True,"So Aman took the robe and the horse, and arrayed Mardochæus, and mounted him on the horse, and went through the street of the city, and proclaimed, saying, Thus shall it be to every man whom the king wishes to honour."
Esther,6,12.0,True,"And Mardochæus returned to the palace: but Aman went home mourning, and having his head covered."
Esther,6,13.0,True,"And Aman related the events that had befallen him to Zosara his wife, and to his friends: and his friends and his wife said to him, If Mardochæus be of the race of the Jews, and thou hast begun to be humbled before him, thou wilt assuredly fall, and thou wilt not be able to withstand him, for the living God is with him."
Esther,6,14.0,True,"While they were yet speaking, the chamberlains arrived, to hasten Aman to the banquet which Esther had prepared."
Esther,7,1.0,True,So the king and Aman went in to drink with the queen.
Esther,7,2.0,True,"And the king said to Esther at the banquet on the second day, What is it, queen Esther? and what is thy request, and what is thy petition? and it shall be done for thee, to the half of my kingdom."
Esther,7,3.0,True,"And she answered and said, If I have found favour in the sight of the king, let my life be granted to my petition, and my people to my request."
Esther,7,4.0,True,"For both I and my people are sold for destruction, and pillage, and slavery; both we and our children for bondmen and bondwomen: and I consented not to it, for the slanderer is not worthy of the king's palace."
Esther,7,5.0,True,"And the king said, Who is this that has dared to do this thing?"
Esther,7,6.0,True,"And Esther said, The adversary is Aman, this wicked man. Then Aman was troubled before the king and the queen."
Esther,7,7.0,True,And the king rose up from the banquet to go into the garden: and Aman began to intreat the queen; for he saw that he was in an evil case.
Esther,7,8.0,True,"And the king returned from the garden; and Aman had fallen upon the bed, intreating the queen. And the king said, Wilt thou even force my wife in my house? And when Aman heard it, he changed countenance."
Esther,7,9.0,True,"And Bugathan, one of the chamberlains, said to the king, Behold, Aman has also prepared a gallows for Mardochæus, who spoke concerning the king, and a gallows of fifty cubits high has been set up in the premises of Aman. And the king said, Let him be hanged thereon."
Esther,7,10.0,True,So Aman was hanged on the gallows that had been prepared for Mardochæus: and then the king's wrath was appeased.
Esther,8,1.0,True,And in that day king Artaxerxes gave to Esther all that belonged to Aman the slanderer: and Mardochæus was called by the king; for Esther had shewn that he was related to her.
Esther,8,2.0,False,"And the king took the ring which he had taken away from Aman, and gave it to Mardochæus: and Esther appointed Mardochæus over all that had been Aman's."
Esther,8,3.0,True,"And she spoke yet again to the king, and fell at his feet, and besought him to do away the mischief of Aman, and all that he had done against the Jews."
Esther,8,4.0,False,Then the king stretched out to Esther the golden sceptre: and Esther arose to stand near the king.
Esther,8,5.0,True,"And Esther said, If it seem good to thee, and I have found favour in thy sight , let an order be sent that the letters sent by Aman may be reversed, that were written for the destruction of the Jews, who are in thy kingdom."
Esther,8,6.0,True,"For how shall I be able to look upon the affliction of my people, and how shall I be able to survive the destruction of my kindred?"
Esther,8,7.0,True,"And the king said to Esther, If I have given and freely granted thee all that was Aman's, and hanged him on a gallows, because he laid his hands upon the Jews, what dost thou yet further seek?"
Esther,8,8.0,True,"Write ye also in my name, as it seems good to you, and seal it with my ring: for whatever orders are written at the command of the king, and sealed with my ring, it is not lawful to gainsay them."
Esther,8,9.0,True,"So the scribes were called in the first month, which is Nisan, on the three and twentieth day of the same year; and orders were written to the Jews, whatever the king had commanded to the local governors and chiefs of the satraps, from India even to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven satraps, according to the several provinces, according to their dialects."
Esther,8,10.0,True,"And they were written by order of the king, and sealed with his ring, and they sent the letters by the posts:"
Esther,8,11.0,True,"wherein he charged them to use their own laws in every city, and to help each other, and to treat their adversaries, and those who attacked them, as they pleased,"
Esther,8,12.0,True,"on one day in all the kingdom of Artaxerxes, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is Adar."
Esther,8,13.0,True,And the following is the copy of the letter of the orders.
Esther,8,13.0,True,"And let the copies be posted in conspicuous places throughout the kingdom, and let all the Jews be ready against this day, to fight against their enemies."
Esther,8,14.0,True,"[The great king Artaxerxes sends greeting to the rulers of provinces in a hundred and twenty-seven satrapies, from India to Ethiopia, even to those who are faithful to our interests."
Esther,8,14.0,True,So the horsemen went forth with haste to perform the king's commands; and the ordinance was also published in Susa.
Esther,8,15.0,True,"Many who have been frequently honoured by the most abundant kindness of their benefactors have conceived ambitious designs, and not only endeavour to hurt our subjects, but moreover, not being able to bear prosperity, they also endeavour to plot against their own benefactors."
Esther,8,15.0,True,"And Mardochæus went forth robed in the royal apparel, and wearing a golden crown, and a diadem of fine purple linen: and the people in Susa saw it and rejoiced."
Esther,8,16.0,True,"And they not only would utterly abolish gratitude from among men, but also, elated by the boastings of men who are strangers to all that is good, they suppose that they shall escape the sin-hating vengeance of the ever-seeing God."
Esther,8,16.0,True,"And the Jews had light and gladness,"
Esther,8,17.0,True,"And oftentimes evil exhortation has made partakers of the guilt of shedding innocent blood, and has involved in irremediable calamities, many of those who were appointed to offices of authority, who had been entrusted with the management of their friends' affairs;"
Esther,8,17.0,True,"in every city and province wherever the ordinance was published: wherever the proclamation took place, the Jews had joy and gladness, feasting and mirth: and many of the Gentiles were circumcised, and became Jews, for fear of the Jews."
Esther,9,1.0,True,"For in the twelfth month, on the thirteenth day of the month which is Adar, the letters written by the king arrived."
Esther,9,2.0,True,"In that day the adversaries of the Jews perished: for no one resisted, through fear of them."
Esther,9,3.0,True,"For the chiefs of the satraps, and the princes and the royal scribes, honoured the Jews; for the fear of Mardochæus lay upon them."
Esther,9,4.0,True,"For the order of the king was in force, that he should be celebrated in all the kingdom."

Esther,9,11.0,True,and the number of them that perished in Susa was rendered to the king.
Esther,9,12.0,True,"And the king said to Esther, The Jews have slain five hundred men in the city Susa; and how, thinkest thou, have they used them in the rest of the country? What then dost thou yet ask, that it may be done for thee?"
Esther,9,13.0,True,"And Esther said to the king, Let it be granted to the Jews so to treat them to-morrow as to hang the ten sons of Aman."
Esther,9,14.0,True,And he permitted it to be so done; and he gave up to the Jews of the city the bodies of the sons of Aman to hang.
Esther,9,15.0,True,"And the Jews assembled in Susa on the fourteenth day of Adar, and slew three hundred men, but plundered no property."
Esther,9,16.0,True,"And the rest of the Jews who were in the kingdom assembled, and helped one another, and obtained rest from their enemies: for they destroyed fifteen thousand of them on the thirteenth day of Adar, but took no spoil."
Esther,9,17.0,True,"And they rested on the fourteenth of the same month, and kept it as a day of rest with joy and gladness."
Esther,9,18.0,True,And the Jews in the city Susa assembled also on the fourteenth day and rested; and they kept also the fifteenth with joy and gladness.
Esther,9,19.0,True,"On this account then it is that the Jews dispersed in every foreign land keep the fourteenth of Adar as a holy day with joy, sending portions each to his neighbour."
Esther,9,20.0,True,"And Mardochæus wrote these things in a book, and sent them to the Jews, as many as were in the kingdom of Artaxerxes, both them that were near and them that were afar off,"
Esther,9,21.0,True,"to establish these as joyful days, and to keep the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar;"
Esther,9,22.0,True,"for on these days the Jews obtained rest from their enemies: and as to the month, which was Adar, in which a change was made for them, from mourning to joy, and from sorrow to a good day, to spend the whole of it in good days of feasting and gladness, sending portions to their friends, and to the poor."
Esther,9,23.0,True,"And the Jews consented to this accordingly as Mardochæus wrote to them,"
Esther,9,24.0,True,"shewing how Aman the son of Amadathes the Macedonian fought against them, how he made a decree and cast lots to destroy them utterly;"
Esther,9,25.0,True,"also how he went in to the king, telling him to hang Mardochæus: but all the calamities he tried to bring upon the Jews came upon himself, and he was hanged, and his children."
Esther,9,26.0,True,"Therefore these days were called Phruræ, because of the lots; (for in their language they are called Phruræ;) because of the words of this letter, and because of all they suffered on this account, and all that happened to them."
Esther,9,27.0,True,"And Mardochæus established it, and the Jews took upon themselves, and upon their seed, and upon those that were joined to them to observe it , neither would they on any account behave differently: but these days were to be a memorial kept in every generation, and city, and family, and province."
Esther,9,28.0,True,"And these days of the Phruræ, said they , shall be kept for ever, and their memorial shall not fail in any generation."

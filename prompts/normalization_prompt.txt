You are an expert in biblical studies and linguistics. Your task is to perform deep semantic decomposition on a given biblical verse. Break down the verse into a series of simple, atomic propositions that capture the full meaning, including speaker, audience, and speech acts (commands, questions, assertions, exclamations).

Return the output as a JSON array of strings.

Here are some examples:

**Example 1:**
Verse: "God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light."
Output:
[
  "God said a command.",
  "God commanded that light should exist.",
  "Light came to exist."
]

**Example 2:**
Verse: "Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?"
Output:
[
  "Jesus asked why his disciples were afraid.",
  "Jesus said that his disciples had little faith."
]

**Example 3:**
Verse: "How majestic is your name in all the earth!"
Output:
[
  "The psalmist exclaimed that God’s name is majestic in all the earth."
]

**Example 4:**
Verse: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."

Output:
[
  "In the beginning, God created the heaven."
  "In the beginning, God created the earth."
]

Now, perform the same decomposition on the following verse.

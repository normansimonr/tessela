RUT,2,6,And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said: 'It is a Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the field of Moab;,[]
RUT,2,7,"and she said: Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves; so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.'",[]
RUT,1,11,"And Naomi said: 'Turn back, my daughters; why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?",[]
RUT,2,4,"And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the reapers: 'The LORD be with you.'

RUT,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed down to the ground, and said unto him: 'Why have I found favour in thy sight, that thou shouldest take cognizance of me, seeing I am a foreigner?'",[]
RUT,2,11,"And Boaz answered and said unto her: 'It hath fully been told me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore.",[]
RUT,2,13,"Then she said: 'Let me find favour in thy sight, my LORD; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.'",[]
RUT,2,15,"And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying: 'Let her glean even among the sheaves, and put her not to shame.",[]
RUT,2,12,"The LORD recompense thy work, and be thy reward complete from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.'",[]
RUT,2,9,"Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them; have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.'","[""Someone is speaking to Ruth."", ""The speaker commands Ruth to let her eyes be on the field that the young men reap."", ""The speaker commands Ruth to go after the young men."", ""The speaker asks Ruth if he has not charged the young men that they shall not touch her."", ""The speaker has charged the young men that they shall not touch Ruth."", ""The speaker commands Ruth that when she is thirsty, she should go unto the vessels."", ""The speaker commands Ruth to drink of that which the young men have drawn.""]"
RUT,2,16,"And also pull out some for her of purpose from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.'",[]
RUT,2,19,"And her mother-in-law said unto her: 'Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.' And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said: 'The man's name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.'",[]
RUT,2,17,"So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.","[""She gleaned in the field."", ""She gleaned until evening."", ""She beat out the barley that she had gleaned."", ""The amount of barley was about an ephah.""]"
RUT,2,20,"And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law: 'Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off His kindness to the living and to the dead.' And Naomi said unto her: 'The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.'",[]
RUT,2,18,"And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned; and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was satisfied.","[""She took up what she had gleaned."", ""She went into the city."", ""Her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned."", ""She brought forth what she had left after she was satisfied."", ""She gave her mother-in-law what she had left after she was satisfied.""]"
RUT,2,5,Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers: 'Whose damsel is this?',[]
RUT,1,22,"So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the field of Moab — and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley harvest.","[""Naomi returned to Bethlehem."", ""Ruth was Naomi's daughter-in-law."", ""Ruth was a Moabitess."", ""Ruth was with Naomi."", ""Naomi and Ruth returned from the field of Moab."", ""Naomi and Ruth arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.""]"
RUT,3,2,"And now is there not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.",[]
RUT,3,1,"And Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her: 'My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?",[]
RUT,2,22,"And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law: 'It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that thou be not met in any other field.'","[""Naomi spoke to Ruth."", ""Ruth is Naomi's daughter-in-law."", ""Naomi said it is good that Ruth go out with his maidens."", ""Naomi said it is good that Ruth not be met in any other field."", ""Naomi addressed Ruth as 'my daughter'.""]"
RUT,2,23,So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.,[]
RUT,3,3,"Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor; but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.",[]
RUT,3,5,And she said unto her: 'All that thou sayest unto me I will do.',[]
RUT,3,6,"And she went down unto the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.",[]
RUT,3,11,"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest; for all the men in the gate of my people do know that thou art a virtuous woman.",[]
RUT,3,12,And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.,[]
RUT,3,10,"And he said: 'Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter; thou hast shown more kindness in the end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou didst not follow the young men, whether poor or rich.",[]
RUT,3,7,"And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn; and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.","[""Boaz had eaten."", ""Boaz had drunk."", ""Boaz's heart was merry."", ""Boaz went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn."", ""She came softly."", ""She uncovered his feet."", ""She laid down.""]"

RUT,3,9,And he said: 'Who art thou?'

RUT,3,14,And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before one could discern another. For he said: 'Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.',[]
RUT,3,16,"And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said: 'Who art thou, my daughter?' And she told her all that the man had done to her.",[]
RUT,4,1,"Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there; and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom he said: 'Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.' And he turned aside, and sat down.",[]
RUT,4,3,"And he said unto the near kinsman: 'Naomi, that is come back out of the field of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's;",[]
RUT,4,2,"And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said: 'Sit ye down here.' And they sat down.","[""He took ten men who were elders of the city."", ""He said a command to the ten men."", ""He commanded the ten men to sit down there."", ""The ten men sat down.""]"
RUT,3,15,"And he said: 'Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it'; and she held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her; and he went into the city.",[]
RUT,4,4,"and I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying: Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it; but if it will not be redeemed, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee.' And he said: 'I will redeem it.'",[]
RUT,4,7,"Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour; and this was the attestation in Israel. —",[]
RUT,4,6,"And the near kinsman said: 'I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance; take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it.' —",[]
RUT,3,17,And she said: 'These six measures of barley gave he me; for he said to me: Go not empty unto thy mother-in-law.',"[""The woman spoke."", ""The woman stated that the man gave her six measures of barley."", ""The man said a command to the woman."", ""The man commanded the woman not to go empty to her mother-in-law.""]"
RUT,3,4,"And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.'",[]
RUT,4,9,"And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people: 'Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.",[]
RUT,4,8,So the near kinsman said unto Boaz: 'Buy it for thyself.'

RUT,4,10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I acquired to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place; ye are witnesses this day.'",[]
RUT,2,8,"Then said Boaz unto Ruth: 'Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.",[]
RUT,2,21,"And Ruth the Moabitess said: 'Yea, he said unto me: Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.'",[]
RUT,3,18,"Then said she: 'Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he have finished the thing this day.'","[""The woman spoke to her daughter."", ""The woman commanded her daughter to remain where she was."", ""The woman said that her daughter should remain where she was until she knew how the matter would turn out."", ""The woman said that the man will not rest."", ""The woman said that the man will not rest until he has finished the thing this day.""]"
RUT,4,11,"And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said: 'We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; and do thou worthily in Ephrath, and be famous in Beth-lehem;",[]
RUT,4,5,"Then said Boaz: 'What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi — hast thou also bought of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance?'","[""Boaz spoke."", ""Boaz asked a question."", ""Boaz asked, 'On what day will you buy the field from Naomi?'"", ""Boaz asked, 'Will you also buy Ruth the Moabitess?'"", ""Ruth the Moabitess is the wife of the dead man."", ""The purpose of buying Ruth is to raise up the name of the dead man upon his inheritance.""]"
RUT,4,15,"And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age; for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.'",[]
RUT,2,14,"And Boaz said unto her at meal-time: 'Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.' And she sat beside the reapers; and they reached her parched corn, and she did eat and was satisfied, and left thereof.",[]
RUT,4,12,"and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.'","[""The people prayed that the house of the listener would be like the house of Perez."", ""Tamar bore Perez to Judah."", ""The people prayed that the LORD would give the listener seed of the young woman.""]"
RUT,4,13,"So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.","[""Boaz took Ruth."", ""Ruth became Boaz's wife."", ""Boaz had sexual relations with Ruth."", ""The LORD enabled Ruth to conceive."", ""Ruth bore a son.""]"
RUT,4,18,Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron;,[]

1SA,1,1,"NOW THERE was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.",[]

1SA,4,2,"And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and when the battle was spread, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.",[]
1SA,3,17,"And he said: 'What is the thing that He hath spoken unto thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me, God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that He spoke unto thee.'",[]
1SA,4,1,"And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer; and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.",[]
1SA,3,20,And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.,[]
1SA,3,21,And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh; for the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.,[]
1SA,4,3,"And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said: 'Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to-day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that He may come among us, and save us out of the hand of our enemies.'",[]
1SA,4,6,"And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said: 'What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?' And they knew that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp.",[]
1SA,4,4,"So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who sitteth upon the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.",[]
1SA,4,5,"And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang.",[]
1SA,4,11,"And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.",[]
1SA,4,7,"And the Philistines were afraid, for they said: 'God is come into the camp.' And they said: 'Woe unto us! for there was not such a thing yesterday and the day before.",[]

1SA,4,9,"Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you; quit yourselves like men, and fight.'",[]
1SA,4,10,"And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent; and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.",[]
1SA,4,13,"And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon his seat by the wayside watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.",[]
1SA,4,14,"And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said: 'What meaneth the noise of this tumult?' And the man made haste, and came and told Eli.",[]
1SA,4,15,"Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were set, that he could not see.",[]
1SA,4,16,"And the man said unto Eli: 'I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day out of the army.' And he said: 'How went the matter, my son?'",[]
1SA,4,19,"And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered; and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth; for her pains came suddenly upon her.",[]
1SA,4,18,"And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.",[]
1SA,4,17,"And he that brought the tidings answered and said: 'Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.'",[]
1SA,4,20,"And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her: 'Fear not; for thou hast brought forth a son.' But she answered not, neither did she regard it.",[]
1SA,4,21,"And she named the child Ichabod, saying: 'The glory is departed from Israel'; because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.",[]
1SA,4,22,And she said: 'The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark of God is taken.',[]
1SA,5,2,"And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.",[]
1SA,5,1,"Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.",[]
1SA,5,4,"And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left to him.",[]

1SA,5,5,"Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.",[]
1SA,5,6,"But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and He destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the borders thereof.",[]
1SA,5,7,"And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said: 'The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us; for His hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.'",[]
1SA,5,8,"They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said: 'What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?' And they answered: 'Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath.' And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.",[]
1SA,5,9,"And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great discomfiture; and He smote the men of the city, both small and great, and emerods broke out upon them.",[]
1SA,5,10,"So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying: 'They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.'",[]
1SA,5,12,And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.,[]
1SA,6,3,"And they said: 'If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return Him a guilt-offering; then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.'",[]
1SA,6,2,"And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying: 'What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? declare unto us wherewith we shall send it to its place.'",[]
1SA,6,7,"Now therefore take and prepare you a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them.",[]
1SA,6,1,And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.,[]
1SA,6,4,"Then said they: 'What shall be the guilt-offering which we shall return to Him?' And they said: 'Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.",[]
1SA,6,5,"Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel; peradventure He will lighten His hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.",[]
1SA,6,6,"Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when He had wrought among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?",[]
1SA,6,10,"And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home.",[]
1SA,6,13,"And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.",[]
1SA,6,12,"And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.",[]
1SA,6,16,"And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.",[]
1SA,6,15,"And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.",[]
1SA,5,11,"They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said: 'Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go back to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people'; for there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.",[]
1SA,6,11,"And they put the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.",[]
1SA,6,14,"And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone; and they cleaved the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine for a burnt-offering unto the LORD.",[]
1SA,6,19,"And He smote of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had gazed upon the ark of the LORD, even He smote of the people seventy men, and fifty thousand men; and the people mourned, because the LORD had smitten the people with a great slaughter.",[]
1SA,6,20,"And the men of Beth-shemesh said: 'Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? and to whom shall it go up from us?'",[]
1SA,6,18,"and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even unto Abel by the great stone, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD, which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.",[]
1SA,6,21,"And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying: 'The Philistines have brought back the ark of the LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.'",[]
1SA,7,2,"And it came to pass, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years; and all the house of Israel yearned after the LORD.",[]
1SA,7,7,"And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.",[]
1SA,7,4,"Then the children of Israel did put away the Baalim and the Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.",[]
1SA,7,5,"And Samuel said: 'Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray for you unto the LORD.'",[]
1SA,7,3,"And Samuel spoke unto all the house of Israel, saying: 'If ye do return unto the LORD with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, and direct your hearts unto the LORD, and serve Him only; and He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.'",[]
1SA,7,6,"And they gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there: 'We have sinned against the LORD.' And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpah.",[]
1SA,7,8,"And the children of Israel said to Samuel: 'Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that He save us out of the hand of the Philistines.'",[]
1SA,7,11,"And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car.",[]
1SA,7,10,"And as Samuel was offering up the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel; but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten down before Israel.",[]
1SA,7,9,"And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt-offering unto the LORD; and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD answered him.",[]
1SA,7,13,"So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within the border of Israel; and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.",[]
1SA,7,12,"Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying: 'Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.'",[]
1SA,7,16,"And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.",[]
1SA,7,15,And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.,[]
1SA,6,8,"And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return Him for a guilt-offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go.",[]
1SA,7,14,"And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the border thereof did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.",[]
1SA,8,3,"And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted justice.",[]
1SA,7,17,"And his return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and he built there an altar unto the LORD.",[]
1SA,8,1,"And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.",[]
1SA,8,4,"Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah.",[]
1SA,8,2,"Now the name of his first-born was Joel; and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judges in Beer-sheba.",[]
1SA,8,7,"And the LORD said unto Samuel: 'Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected Me, that I should not be king over them.",[]
1SA,8,5,"And they said unto him: 'Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways; now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.'",[]
1SA,8,10,And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king.,[]
1SA,8,8,"According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, in that they have forsaken Me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.",[]
1SA,8,9,"Now therefore hearken unto their voice; howbeit thou shalt earnestly forewarn them, and shalt declare unto them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.'",[]
1SA,8,11,"And he said: 'This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them unto him, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run before his chariots.",[]
1SA,8,15,"And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.",[]
1SA,8,14,"And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.",[]
1SA,8,13,"And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks, and to be bakers.",[]
1SA,8,12,"And he will appoint them unto him for captains of thousands, and captains of fifties; and to plow his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and the instruments of his chariots.",[]
1SA,8,20,"that we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.'",[]
1SA,8,16,"And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.",[]
1SA,8,19,But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel; and they said: 'Nay; but there shall be a king over us;,[]
1SA,8,18,And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not answer you in that day.',[]
1SA,9,2,"And he had a son, whose name was Saul, young and goodly, and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.",[]
1SA,9,4,"And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they found them not; then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they were not; and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.",[]

1SA,7,1,"And the men of Kiriath-jearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.",[]
1SA,6,17,"And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines returned for a guilt-offering unto the LORD: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;",[]

1SA,9,9,"Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said: 'Come and let us go to the seer'; for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer. —",[]

1SA,9,6,"And he said unto him: 'Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man that is held in honour; all that he saith cometh surely to pass; now let us go thither; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.'",[]
1SA,9,5,"When they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him: 'Come and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and become anxious concerning us.'",[]
1SA,8,17,He will take the tenth of your flocks; and ye shall be his servants.,[]
1SA,9,10,"Then said Saul to his servant: 'Well said; come, let us go.' So they went unto the city where the man of God was.",[]
1SA,8,6,"But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said: 'Give us a king to judge us.' And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.",[]
1SA,9,12,"And they answered them, and said: 'He is; behold, he is before thee; make haste now, for he is come to-day into the city; for the people have a sacrifice to-day in the high place.",[]

1SA,9,13,"As soon as ye are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that are bidden.

1SA,9,11,"As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them: 'Is the seer here?'",[]

JDG,5,14,"Out of Ephraim came they whose root is in Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the marshal's staff.",[]
JDG,6,13,"And Gideon said unto him: 'Oh, my lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where are all His wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying: Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.'",[]

JDG,6,21,"Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.",[]
JDG,6,24,"Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it 'Adonai-shalom'; unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.",[]
JDG,6,30,"Then the men of the city said unto Joash: 'Bring out thy son, that he may die; because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it.'",[]
JDG,6,34,But the spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon; and he blew a horn; and Abiezer was gathered together after him.,[]
JDG,6,33,"Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.",[]
JDG,7,12,"Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the sea-shore for multitude.",[]
JDG,6,31,"And Joash said unto all that stood against him: 'Will ye contend for Baal? or will ye save him? he that will contend for him, shall be put to death before morning; if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one hath broken down his altar.'",[]
JDG,7,4,"And the LORD said unto Gideon: 'The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there; and it shall be, that of whom I say to thee: This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee: This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.'",[]

JDG,7,5,"So he brought down the people unto the water; and the LORD said unto Gideon: 'Everyone that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.'",[]
JDG,7,6,"And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.",[]
JDG,7,7,"And the LORD said unto Gideon: 'By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let all the people go every man unto his place.'",[]
JDG,7,13,"And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man telling a dream unto his follow, and saying: 'Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came unto the tent, and smote it that it fell, and turned it upside down, that the tent lay flat.'",[]
JDG,8,1,"And the men of Ephraim said unto him: 'Why hast thou served us thus, that thou didst not call us when thou wentest to fight with Midian?' And they did chide with him sharply.",[]
JDG,8,3,"God hath delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?' Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.",[]
JDG,7,14,"And his fellow answered and said: 'This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand God hath delivered Midian, and all the host.'",[]
JDG,7,18,"When I blow the horn, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the horns also on every side of all the camp, and say: For the LORD and for Gideon!'",[]
JDG,7,17,"And he said unto them: 'Look on me, and do likewise; and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.",[]
JDG,7,25,"And they took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb at the Rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the Winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.",[]
JDG,7,21,"And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and fled.",[]
JDG,7,20,"And the three companies blew the horns, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the horns in their right hands wherewith to blow; and they cried: 'The sword for the LORD and for Gideon!'",[]
JDG,8,7,"And Gideon said: 'Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.'",[]
JDG,8,11,"And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.",[]
JDG,8,9,"And he spoke also unto the men of Penuel, saying: 'When I come back in peace, I will break down this tower.'",[]
JDG,8,15,"And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said: 'Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying: Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?'",[]
JDG,8,16,"And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.",[]
JDG,8,17,"And he broke down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.",[]
JDG,8,20,"And he said unto Jether his first-born: 'Up, and slay them.' But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth.",[]
JDG,8,18,"Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna: 'Where are the men whom ye slew at Tabor?' And they answered: 'As thou art, so were they; of one form with the children of a king.'",[]
JDG,8,22,"Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon: 'Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also; for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Midian.'",[]
JDG,8,25,"And they answered: 'We will willingly give them.' And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil.",[]
JDG,9,6,"And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all Beth-millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the terebinth of the pillar that was in Shechem.",[]
JDG,8,27,"And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah; and all Israel went astray after it there; and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.",[]
JDG,9,40,"And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even unto the entrance of the gate.",[]
JDG,8,21,"Then Zebah and Zalmunna said: 'Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength.' And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels' necks.",[]
JDG,8,28,"So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.",[]
JDG,9,4,"And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him.",[]
JDG,9,35,"And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the ambushment.",[]
JDG,9,15,"And the bramble said unto the trees: If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shadow; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.",[]
JDG,9,27,"And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.",[]
JDG,9,32,"Now therefore, up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field.",[]
JDG,9,41,"And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah; and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.",[]
JDG,11,1,"Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was the son of a harlot; and Gilead begot Jephthah.",[]
JDG,9,44,"And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city; and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and smote them.",[]
JDG,9,52,"And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went close unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.",[]
JDG,9,55,"And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.",[]
JDG,11,6,"And they said unto Jephthah: 'Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.'",[]
JDG,10,16,"And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD; and His soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.",[]
JDG,10,2,"And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.",[]
JDG,11,7,"And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead: 'Did not ye hate me, and drive me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?'",[]
JDG,11,9,"And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead: 'If ye bring me back home to fight with the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, I will be your head.'",[]
JDG,11,10,And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah: 'The LORD shall be witness between us; surely according to thy word so will we do.',[]
JDG,11,16,"But when they came up from Egypt, and Israel walked through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh;",[]
JDG,11,24,"Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God hath dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.",[]
JDG,11,12,"And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying: 'What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land?'",[]
JDG,11,17,"then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying: Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not. And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not; and Israel abode in Kadesh.",[]
JDG,11,22,"And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan.",[]
JDG,11,23,"So now the LORD, the God of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorites from before His people Israel, and shouldest thou possess them?",[]
JDG,11,33,"And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto Abel-cheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.",[]
JDG,12,2,"And Jephthah said unto them: 'I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye saved me not out of their hand.",[]
JDG,11,32,So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hand.,[]
JDG,13,18,"And the angel of the LORD said unto him: 'Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is hidden?'",[]
JDG,13,3,"And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her: 'Behold now, thou art barren, and hast not borne; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.",[]
JDG,13,20,"For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar; and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.",[]
JDG,13,22,"And Manoah said unto his wife: 'We shall surely die, because we have seen God.'",[]
JDG,16,15,"And she said unto him: 'How canst thou say: I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.'",[]
JDG,16,19,"And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and had the seven locks of his head shaven off; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.",[]
JDG,16,12,"So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him: 'The Philistines are upon thee, Samson.' And the liers-in-wait were abiding in the inner chamber. And he broke them from off his arms like a thread.",[]
JDG,16,18,"And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying: 'Come up this once, for he hath told me all his heart.' Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought the money in their hand.",[]
JDG,16,2,"And it was told the Gazites, saying: 'Samson is come hither.' And they compassed him in, and lay in wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying: 'Let be till morning light, then we will kill him.'",[]
JDG,16,21,"And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison-house.",[]
JDG,16,25,"And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said: 'Call for Samson, that he may make us sport.' And they called for Samson out of the prison-house; and he made sport before them; and they set him between the pillars.",[]
JDG,16,26,"And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand: 'Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house resteth, that I may lean upon them.'",[]
JDG,16,29,"And Samson took fast hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and leaned upon them, the one with his right hand, and the other with his left.",[]
JDG,17,7,"And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem in Judah — in the family of Judah — who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.",[]
JDG,16,30,"And Samson said: 'Let me die with the Philistines.' And he bent with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead that he slew at his death were more than they that he slew in his life.",[]
JDG,17,3,"And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said: 'I verily dedicate the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image; now therefore I will restore it unto thee.'",[]
JDG,17,5,"And the man Micah had a house of God, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.",[]
JDG,18,4,"And he said unto them: 'Thus and thus hath Micah dealt with me, and he hath hired me, and I am become his priest.'",[]
JDG,17,8,"And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem in Judah, to sojourn where he could find a place; and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.",[]
JDG,18,3,"When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside thither, and said unto him: 'Who brought thee hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?'",[]
JDG,18,5,"And they said unto him: 'Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we are going shall be prosperous.'",[]
JDG,18,8,And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol; and their brethren said unto them: 'What say ye?',[]
JDG,18,18,"And when these went into Micah's house, and fetched the graven image of the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said unto them: 'What do ye?'",[]
JDG,18,13,"And they passed thence unto the hill-country of Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah.",[]
JDG,18,21,"So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the goods before them.",[]
JDG,18,22,"When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.",[]
JDG,18,29,"And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel; howbeit the name of the city was Laish at the first.",[]
JDG,18,23,"And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah: 'What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company?'",[]
JDG,18,25,"And the children of Dan said unto him: 'Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.'",[]
JDG,18,26,"And the children of Dan went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.",[]
JDG,18,28,"And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by Beth-rehob. And they built the city, and dwelt therein.",[]
JDG,18,27,"And they took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people quiet and secure, and smote them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt the city with fire.",[]
JDG,19,2,"And his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Beth-lehem in Judah, and was there the space of four months.",[]
JDG,18,30,"And the children of Dan set up for themselves the graven image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.",[]
JDG,18,31,"So they set them up Micah's graven image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.",[]
JDG,19,8,"And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and the damsel's father said: 'Stay thy heart, I pray thee, and tarry ye until the day declineth'; and they did eat, both of them.",[]
JDG,19,1,"And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Beth-lehem in Judah.",[]
JDG,19,3,"And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly unto her, to bring her back, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses; and she brought him into her father's house; and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.",[]
JDG,19,4,"And his father-in-law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days; so they did eat and drink, and lodged there.",[]
JDG,19,9,"And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel's father, said unto him: 'Behold, now the day draweth toward evening; tarry, I pray you, all night; behold, the day groweth to an end; lodge here, that thy heart may be merry; and to-morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.'",[]
JDG,19,5,"And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning, and he rose up to depart; and the damsel's father said unto his son-in-law: 'Stay thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward ye shall go your way.'",[]
JDG,19,7,"And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him, and he lodged there again.",[]
JDG,19,13,"And he said unto his servant: 'Come and let us draw near to one of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.'",[]
JDG,19,17,"And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the broad place of the city; and the old man said: 'Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou?'",[]
JDG,19,11,"When they were by Jebus — the day was far spent — the servant said unto his master: 'Come, I pray thee, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.'",[]
JDG,19,10,"But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus — the same is Jerusalem; and there were with him a couple of asses saddled; his concubine also was with him.",[]
JDG,19,23,"And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them: 'Nay, my brethren, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, do not this wanton deed.",[]
JDG,19,16,"And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even; now the man was of the hill-country of Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.",[]
JDG,19,15,"And they turned aside thither, to go in to lodge in Gibeah; and he went in, and sat him down in the broad place of the city; for there was no man that took them into his house to lodge.",[]
JDG,19,20,And the old man said: 'Peace be unto thee; howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the broad place.',[]
JDG,19,22,"As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying: 'Bring forth the man that came into thy house, that we may know him.'",[]
JDG,19,14,"So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them near to Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.",[]
JDG,19,27,"And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands upon the threshold.",[]
JDG,19,26,"Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was light.",[]
JDG,19,28,"And he said unto her. 'Up, and let us be going'; but none answered; then he took her up upon the ass; and the man rose up, and got him unto his place.",[]
JDG,19,29,"And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.",[]
JDG,19,30,"And it was so, that all that saw it said: 'Such a thing hath not happened nor been seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak.'",[]
JDG,20,4,"And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was murdered, answered and said: 'I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.",[]
JDG,20,5,"And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night; me they thought to have slain, and my concubine they forced, and she is dead.",[]
JDG,20,7,"Behold, ye are all here, children of Israel, give here your advice and council.'",[]
JDG,20,8,"And all the people arose as one man, saying: 'We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn unto his house.",[]
JDG,20,1,"Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD at Mizpah.",[]
JDG,20,13,"Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows that are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.' But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.",[]
JDG,20,9,But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot;,[]
JDG,20,12,"And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying: 'What wickedness is this that is come to pass among you?",[]
JDG,20,10,"and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victuals for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the wantonness that they have wrought in Israel.'",[]
JDG,20,18,"And the children of Israel arose, and went up to Beth-el, and asked counsel of God; and they said: 'Who shall go up for us first to battle against the children of Benjamin?' And the LORD said: 'Judah first.'",[]
JDG,20,11,"So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.",[]
JDG,20,14,"And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of their cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel.",[]
JDG,20,20,And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.,[]
JDG,20,21,"And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men.",[]
JDG,20,15,"And the children of Benjamin numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered seven hundred chosen men.",[]
JDG,20,25,"And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.",[]
JDG,20,27,"And the children of Israel asked of the LORD — for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,",[]
JDG,20,23,"And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even; and they asked of the LORD, saying: 'Shall I again draw nigh to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?' And the LORD said: 'Go up against him.'",[]
JDG,20,22,"And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.",[]
JDG,20,30,"And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.",[]
JDG,20,28,"and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days — saying: 'Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?' And the LORD said: 'Go up; for to-morrow I will deliver him into thy hand.'",[]
JDG,20,29,And Israel set liers-in-wait against Gibeah round about.,[]
JDG,20,31,"And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite and kill of the people, as at other times, in the field, in the highways, of which one goeth up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, about thirty men of Israel.",[]
JDG,20,32,"And the children of Benjamin said: 'They are smitten down before us, as at the first.' But the children of Israel said: 'Let us flee, and draw them away from the city unto the highways.'",[]
JDG,20,37,"And the liers-in-wait hastened, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers-in-wait drew forth, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.",[]
JDG,20,33,"And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar; and the liers-in-wait of Israel broke forth out of their place, even out of Maareh-geba.",[]
JDG,20,35,And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men; all these drew the sword.,[]
JDG,20,39,"And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said: 'Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.'",[]
JDG,20,38,"Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers-in-wait, that they should make a great beacon of smoke rise up out of the city. —",[]
JDG,20,40,"But when the beacon began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven.",[]
JDG,20,43,"They inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and overtook them at their resting-place, as far as over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.",[]
JDG,20,42,Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard after them; and they that came out of the city destroyed them in the midst of the men of Israel.,[]
JDG,20,47,"But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.",[]
JDG,20,45,"And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon; and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and followed hard after them unto Gidom, and smote of them two thousand men.",[]
JDG,20,46,So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.,[]
JDG,20,44,And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.,[]
JDG,21,2,"And the people came to Beth-el, and sat there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore.",[]
JDG,20,48,"And the men of Israel turned back upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city, and the cattle, and all that they found; moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.",[]
JDG,21,4,"And it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.",[]
JDG,21,5,"And the children of Israel said: 'Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up in the assembly unto the LORD?' For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up unto the LORD to Mizpah, saying: 'He shall surely be put to death.'",[]
JDG,21,7,"How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?'",[]
JDG,21,8,"And they said: 'What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up unto the LORD to Mizpah?' And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.",[]
JDG,21,13,"And the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace unto them.",[]
JDG,21,12,"And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, that had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.",[]
JDG,21,9,"For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there.",[]
JDG,21,10,"And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying: 'Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.",[]
JDG,21,14,And Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead; and yet so they sufficed them not.,[]
JDG,21,16,"Then the elders of the congregation said: 'How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?'",[]
JDG,21,15,"And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.",[]
JDG,21,17,"And they said: 'They that are escaped must be as an inheritance for Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel.",[]
JDG,21,19,"And they said: 'Behold, there is the feast of the LORD from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Beth-el, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Beth-el to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.'",[]
JDG,21,18,"Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters.' For the children of Israel had sworn, saying: 'Cursed be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.'",[]
JDG,21,20,"And they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying: 'Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;",[]
JDG,21,21,"and see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.",[]
JDG,21,22,"And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come to strive with us, that we will say unto them: Grant them graciously unto us; because we took not for each man of them his wife in battle; neither did ye give them unto them, that ye should now be guilty.'",[]
RUT,1,3,"And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.",[]
RUT,1,4,"And they took them wives of the women of Moab: the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth; and they dwelt there about ten years.",[]
JDG,21,24,"And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance.",[]
JDG,21,23,"And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they carried off; and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them.",[]
JDG,21,25,In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.,[]
RUT,1,1,"AND IT came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem in Judah went to sojourn in the field of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.",[]
RUT,1,2,"And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem in Judah. And they came into the field of Moab, and continued there.",[]
RUT,1,5,And Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.,[]
RUT,1,6,"Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the field of Moab; for she had heard in the field of Moab how that the LORD had remembered His people in giving them bread.",[]
RUT,1,16,"And Ruth said: 'Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee; for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God;",[]
RUT,1,11,"And Naomi said: 'Turn back, my daughters; why will ye go with me? have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?",[]
RUT,1,12,"Turn back, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say: I have hope, should I even have an husband to-night, and also bear sons;",[]
RUT,1,14,"And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved unto her.",[]
RUT,1,13,"would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye shut yourselves off for them and have no husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, for the hand of the LORD is gone forth against me.'",[]
RUT,1,15,"And she said: 'Behold, thy sister-in-law is gone back unto her people, and unto her god; return thou after thy sister-in-law.'",[]
RUT,1,19,"So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was astir concerning them, and the women said: 'Is this Naomi?'",[]
RUT,1,17,"where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried; the LORD do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.'",[]
RUT,1,18,"And when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking unto her.",[]
RUT,1,20,"And she said unto them: 'Call me not Naomi, call me Marah; for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.",[]
RUT,2,2,"And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi: 'Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find favour.' And she said unto her: 'Go, my daughter.'",[]
RUT,2,3,"And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers; and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.",[]
RUT,2,5,Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers: 'Whose damsel is this?',[]
RUT,2,7,"and she said: Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves; so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.'",[]
RUT,2,6,And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said: 'It is a Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the field of Moab;,[]
RUT,2,8,"Then said Boaz unto Ruth: 'Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.",[]
RUT,2,1,"And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of valour, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.",[]
RUT,2,10,"Then she fell on her face, and bowed down to the ground, and said unto him: 'Why have I found favour in thy sight, that thou shouldest take cognizance of me, seeing I am a foreigner?'",[]
RUT,2,11,"And Boaz answered and said unto her: 'It hath fully been told me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore.",[]
RUT,2,12,"The LORD recompense thy work, and be thy reward complete from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.'",[]
RUT,2,20,"And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law: 'Blessed be he of the LORD, who hath not left off His kindness to the living and to the dead.' And Naomi said unto her: 'The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.'",[]
RUT,2,13,"Then she said: 'Let me find favour in thy sight, my LORD; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken to the heart of thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.'",[]
RUT,2,14,"And Boaz said unto her at meal-time: 'Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.' And she sat beside the reapers; and they reached her parched corn, and she did eat and was satisfied, and left thereof.",[]
RUT,2,15,"And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying: 'Let her glean even among the sheaves, and put her not to shame.",[]
RUT,2,19,"And her mother-in-law said unto her: 'Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.' And she told her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said: 'The man's name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.'",[]
RUT,2,16,"And also pull out some for her of purpose from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.'",[]
RUT,2,21,"And Ruth the Moabitess said: 'Yea, he said unto me: Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.'",[]
RUT,3,4,"And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.'",[]
RUT,3,1,"And Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her: 'My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?",[]
RUT,2,23,So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.,[]
RUT,3,2,"And now is there not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.",[]
RUT,3,10,"And he said: 'Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter; thou hast shown more kindness in the end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou didst not follow the young men, whether poor or rich.",[]
RUT,3,5,And she said unto her: 'All that thou sayest unto me I will do.',[]
RUT,3,3,"Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor; but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.",[]
RUT,3,13,"Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part; but if he be not willing to do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth; lie down until the morning.'",[]
RUT,3,6,"And she went down unto the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.",[]
RUT,3,12,And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I.,[]
RUT,3,11,"And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou sayest; for all the men in the gate of my people do know that thou art a virtuous woman.",[]
RUT,3,15,"And he said: 'Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it'; and she held it; and he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her; and he went into the city.",[]
RUT,3,16,"And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said: 'Who art thou, my daughter?' And she told her all that the man had done to her.",[]
RUT,4,1,"Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there; and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom he said: 'Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.' And he turned aside, and sat down.",[]
RUT,4,4,"and I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying: Buy it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it; but if it will not be redeemed, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee.' And he said: 'I will redeem it.'",[]
RUT,3,14,And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before one could discern another. For he said: 'Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.',[]
RUT,4,3,"And he said unto the near kinsman: 'Naomi, that is come back out of the field of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's;",[]
RUT,4,6,"And the near kinsman said: 'I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance; take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it.' —",[]
RUT,4,9,"And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people: 'Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.",[]
RUT,4,10,"Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I acquired to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place; ye are witnesses this day.'",[]
RUT,4,7,"Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour; and this was the attestation in Israel. —",[]
RUT,4,15,"And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age; for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.'",[]
RUT,4,16,"And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.",[]
RUT,4,17,"And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying: 'There is a son born to Naomi'; and they called his name Obed; he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.",[]
RUT,4,18,Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron;,[]
RUT,4,11,"And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said: 'We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel; and do thou worthily in Ephrath, and be famous in Beth-lehem;",[]
RUT,4,20,"and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon;",[]
RUT,4,19,"and Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab;",[]
RUT,4,21,"and Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed;",[]
RUT,4,22,"and Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David.",[]
1SA,1,1,"NOW THERE was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill-country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.",[]
1SA,1,3,"And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there priests unto the LORD.",[]
1SA,1,2,"And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.",[]
1SA,1,5,"but unto Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but the LORD had shut up her womb.",[]
1SA,1,6,"And her rival vexed her sore, to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.",[]
1SA,1,9,"So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk — now Eli the priest sat upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of the LORD;",[]
1SA,1,7,"And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she vexed her; therefore she wept, and would not eat.",[]
1SA,1,4,"And it came to pass upon a day, when Elkanah sacrificed, that he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions;",[]
1SA,1,11,"And she vowed a vow, and said: 'O LORD of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thy handmaid, but wilt give unto Thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.'",[]
1SA,1,10,"and she was in bitterness of soul — and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.",[]
1SA,1,12,"And it came to pass, as she prayed long before the LORD, that Eli watched her mouth.",[]
1SA,1,17,"Then Eli answered and said: 'Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou hast asked of Him.'",[]
1SA,1,14,And Eli said unto her: 'How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.',[]
1SA,1,15,"And Hannah answered and said: 'No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before the LORD.",[]
1SA,1,13,"Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard; therefore, Eli thought she had been drunken.",[]
1SA,1,16,Count not thy handmaid for a wicked woman: for out of the abundance of my complaint and my vexation have I spoken hitherto.',[]
1SA,1,20,"And it came to pass, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she called his name Samuel: 'because I have asked him of the LORD.'",[]
1SA,1,21,"And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.",[]
1SA,1,18,"And she said: 'Let thy servant find favour in thy sight.' So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.",[]
1SA,1,19,"And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah; and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.",[]
1SA,1,22,"But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband: 'Until the child be weaned, when I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.'",[]
1SA,2,1,"And Hannah prayed, and said: my heart exulteth in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD; my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in Thy salvation.",[]
1SA,1,24,"And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh; and the child was young.",[]
1SA,1,25,"And when the bullock was slain, the child was brought to Eli.",[]
1SA,1,26,"And she said: 'Oh, my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.",[]
1SA,1,28,therefore I also have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he is lent to the LORD.' And he worshipped the LORD there.,[]
1SA,2,2,"There is none holy as the LORD, for there is none beside Thee; neither is there any rock like our God.",[]
1SA,1,27,For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath granted me my petition which I asked of Him;,"[""Hannah prayed for a child."", ""The Lord has granted Hannah's petition."", ""Hannah asked the Lord for this child.""]"
1SA,1,23,"And Elkanah her husband said unto her: 'Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish His word.' So the woman tarried and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.",[]
1SA,2,3,"Multiply not exceeding proud talk; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth; for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed.",[]
1SA,2,4,"The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.",[]
1SA,2,6,"The LORD killeth, and maketh alive; He bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.",[]
1SA,2,5,"They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry have ceased; while the barren hath borne seven, she that had many children hath languished.",[]
1SA,2,7,"The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich; He bringeth low, He also lifteth up.",[]
1SA,2,8,"He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, He lifteth up the needy from the dung-hill, to make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory; for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and He hath set the world upon them.",[]
1SA,2,9,"He will keep the feet of His holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for not by strength shall man prevail.",[]
1SA,2,10,"They that strive with the LORD shall be broken to pieces; against them will He thunder in heaven; the LORD will judge the ends of the earth; and He will give strength unto His king, and exalt the horn of His anointed.",[]
1SA,2,13,"And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his band;",[]
1SA,2,11,And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.,[]
1SA,2,12,Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not the LORD.,[]
1SA,2,14,"and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did unto all the Israelites that came thither in Shiloh.",[]
1SA,2,15,"Yea, before the fat was made to smoke, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed: 'Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.'",[]
1SA,2,17,And the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD; for the men dealt contemptuously with the offering of the LORD.,[]
1SA,2,16,"And if the man said unto him: 'Let the fat be made to smoke first of all, and then take as much as thy soul desireth'; then he would say: 'Nay, but thou shalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force.'",[]
1SA,2,18,"But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.",[]
1SA,2,20,"And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say: 'The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to the LORD.' And they would go unto their own home.",[]
1SA,2,21,"So the LORD remembered Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.",[]
1SA,2,22,"Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.",[]
1SA,2,26,"And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.",[]
1SA,2,19,"Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.",[]
1SA,2,23,And he said unto them: 'Why do ye such things? for I hear evil reports concerning you from all this people.,[]
1SA,2,24,"Nay, my sons; for it is no good report which I hear the LORD'S people do spread abroad.",[]
1SA,2,25,"If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him?' But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.",[]
1SA,2,28,"And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up unto Mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?",[]
1SA,2,27,"And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him: 'Thus saith the LORD: Did I reveal Myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house?",[]

1SA,2,29,"Wherefore kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine offering, which I have commanded in My habitation; and honourest thy sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel My people?",[]
1SA,2,30,"Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, saith: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before Me for ever; but now the LORD saith: Be it far from Me: for them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.",[]
1SA,2,33,"Yet will I not cut off every man of thine from Mine altar, to make thine eyes to fail, and thy heart to languish; and all the increase of thy house shall die young men.",[]
